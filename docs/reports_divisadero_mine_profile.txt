Divisadero Mine Research Report (for MRDS + Remote Sensing Workflow)
Date: 2026-02-16
Prepared by: Codex (GPT-5)

Scope
- Identify mined-history sites in the El Salvador MRDS subset used in this project.
- Build a deeper profile for Divisadero Mine that supports long-run remote-sensing trend analysis.
- Prioritize operation timeline, commodities, geology, and environmental signals relevant to NDVI/bare-soil/index trend interpretation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Mined-History Sites (Selection for GEE Targeting)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selection rule used in MRDS metadata: dev_stat contains "Producer" (in this dataset, all selected rows are "Past Producer").

Selected mine names:
1. Divisadero Mine
2. El Porvenir
3. Hormiguero Mine
4. Monte Cristo Mine
5. Monte Mayor Mine
6. Potosi Mine
7. San Juan Mine
8. San Sebastian Mine

Project note:
- The GEE script is now configured with a manual name list for these eight mines so Earth Engine does not need to parse MRDS metadata at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Divisadero Mine: Evidence Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Identity and commodity
- MRDS record (labno 10085938): Divisadero Mine, coordinates near 13.60091, -88.06002.
- Primary commodities are gold and silver (MRDS commod1), with gold as principal ore.

Interpretation relevance:
- Gold-silver vein systems often produce narrow, heterogeneous disturbance footprints;
  1 km and 2 km buffers are appropriate for capturing both direct mine disturbance and adjacent land-use changes.

2.2 Operations timeline (confidence-graded)
High confidence (SEC-filed technical disclosure / historical compilation references):
- The SEC-filed project history for the San Cristobal area states Divisadero was one of the historically productive mines and reports:
  - operation in the early 1900s (notably 1907-1917 period),
  - substantial hoisted tonnage in 1915-1916,
  - gold-silver grades cited from historical compilations,
  - later inactivity and modern-era exploration interest.

Moderate confidence (industry press / secondary historical synthesis):
- Industry reporting around Intrepid-era disclosures describes the district as containing four past-producing mines including Divisadero.
- Historical narratives describe early activity beginning in the 19th century and intense operation around the Butters period.

RS implication:
- Landsat-era analysis (1984 onward) mostly captures post-major-production legacy conditions,
  reworking, revegetation, and downstream disturbance signatures rather than primary production-era land clearing.

2.3 Geology and structural context
- SEC technical disclosures describe the San Cristobal project area (including Divisadero) as Au-Ag vein mineralization in volcanic units.
- Host rocks are described as dominantly andesite with related volcanic units.
- Structural control includes NW-trending faults and vein systems.

RS implication:
- Structural lineaments and steep slopes can influence reflectance and topographic shading;
  for inter-annual trend stability, dry-season compositing and optional topographic correction remain important.

2.4 Environmental signal and risk context
Divisadero-specific direct environmental reporting:
- Strong, site-specific public contamination documentation for Divisadero itself is limited in accessible sources reviewed here.

Regional mining-environment context (important but not equivalent to site-specific proof):
- San Sebastian (different mine, same broader eastern mining context) is associated in official/regulatory reporting with severe acid drainage and heavy-metal concerns.
- ICSID case materials and related disclosures document prolonged environmental permit conflict in El Salvador's metallic mining sector.

Interpretation rule for this project:
- Treat Divisadero as a legacy mine with uncertain directly published contamination records;
  use RS trend outputs as a screening layer, then pair anomalies with targeted field/lab evidence where possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Recommended Analytical Workflow (GEE + Python/Excel)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 In GEE (compute-efficient extraction)
- Use manual target site list (no metadata parsing).
- Keep 1 km and 2 km buffers.
- Use dry-season annual composites.
- Keep full Landsat-era export window (1984 to last full year).
- Cap seasonal images (maxImagesPerSeason) to control runtime.
- Export long-form CSV with:
  - NDVI metrics,
  - bare/sparse/vegetation area fractions,
  - additional indices: NDMI, NDBI, NDTI, SAVI, BSI.

3.2 Outside GEE (trend analysis)
- Use Python script: analysis/mrds_trends.py
- Inputs: GEE long CSV export(s).
- Outputs:
  - *_clean.csv (Excel-friendly cleaned annual rows)
  - *_trend_summary.csv (per-site, per-buffer, per-metric trend slopes and direction)

Example command:
python3 analysis/mrds_trends.py \
  --input gee/groundwork/MRDSoutputs/Divisadero_Mine_2013_2025.csv

Excel workflow:
- Load *_trend_summary.csv
- Filter metric and buffer_m
- Build line charts from *_clean.csv
- Use slope columns (OLS and Theil-Sen) for quick ranking of sites/metrics by trend strength.

4) Data Gaps and Next Research Actions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current gaps:
- Exact Divisadero operation start/stop years by shaft/level are not consistently available in open-access summaries.
- Public, site-specific modern water/soil chemistry records for Divisadero are sparse in sources reviewed.

Priority next sources to request/find:
1. Full technical report appendices (historic production tables by mine and year).
2. Government environmental monitoring records near El Divisadero drainage.
3. Archive geologic maps cross-referenced to mine workings and modern land cover.

Notes on evidence quality:
- Items 1-3 are strongest for this workflow.
- Items 4-5 are useful but secondary industry reporting.
- Items 6-7 are contextual for policy/environment framing and should not be treated as Divisadero-specific contamination proof.
