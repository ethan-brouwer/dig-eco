# dig-eco

## Overview
dig-eco is a collaborative research codebase for remote sensing analysis of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and associated turbidity and water-quality impacts. The repository emphasizes reproducibility, transparent methods, and research-grade workflows suitable for publication.

## Goals
- Remote sensing classification of ASM
- Turbidity and water-quality analysis associated with mining
- Modular, scalable classification workflows
- Transparent version history and reproducible science
- Designed for collaboration, expansion, and publication

## Repository structure
- `gee/`: Google Earth Engine workflows (ASM, turbidity, shared utilities)
- `docs/`: project documentation, methodology, and literature summaries
- `data/`: raw, processed, and reference data staging
- `analysis/`: notebooks and figures
- `tests/`: test scaffolding

## Collaboration
- Branches: `main` (stable), `dev` (integration), `feature/<short-description>`
- No direct commits to `main`
- All changes via pull request

## Contributors
- Ethan Brouwer
