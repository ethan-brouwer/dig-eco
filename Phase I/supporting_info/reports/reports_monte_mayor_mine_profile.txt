Monte Mayor Mine Research Report (for MRDS + Remote Sensing Workflow)
Date: 2026-02-17
Prepared by: Codex (GPT-5)

Scope
- Provide the remaining mine profile for the `part_0_of_4` cohort.
- Focus on historical context, commodity/mineralization, geology, and environmental interpretation relevance.
- Explicitly flag where evidence is strong vs. uncertain.

Context: `part_0_of_4` site membership
- Divisadero Mine (already reported)
- El Porvenir (already reported)
- Monte Mayor Mine (this report)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) MRDS Record Snapshot Used in Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the project MRDS CSV row for Monte Mayor Mine:
- Name: Monte Mayor Mine
- MRDS labno: 10085940
- Coordinates: 13.70090, -87.97002
- Development status: Past Producer
- Operation type: Unknown
- Ore: Gold
- commod1: Gold, Silver

Interpretation:
- Legacy Au-Ag producer (historical mining has occurred).
- Suitable for inclusion in long-run disturbance/recovery trend analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Historical Context (Evidence-Graded)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 High-confidence records
- USGS Circular 858-A (1981) includes "MONTE MAYOR" in the El Salvador metallic occurrence list, with commodities AU-AG and coordinates N13 42, W087 58.
- Your MRDS row classifies Monte Mayor as "Past Producer," confirming historical extraction occurred at some point.

2.2 Moderate-confidence contextual records
- USGS-linked secondary aggregation (The Diggings entry keyed to USGS 10085940) identifies Monte Mayor as a small Au-Ag site with historical alternate names (Santa Gertrudia, Carao, Tempisque, Banadeto, Las Tunas Veins), suggesting a broader local vein/working-name system rather than a single isolated working.

2.3 Key uncertainty
- Publicly accessible sources reviewed do not provide a robust year-by-year Monte Mayor production chronology (start/stop years, tonnage, grade by year) at the same depth available for some neighboring mines.
- Therefore, detailed annual operations timeline for Monte Mayor remains a data gap.

Working historical synthesis:
- Monte Mayor is defensibly a historical Au-Ag producer in eastern El Salvador, but exact operational sequencing is not well constrained in open sources used here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Geology and Mineralization Relevance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-confidence (from MRDS + USGS listing level):
- Commodity class: Au-Ag.

Moderate-confidence (secondary USGS-linked aggregation):
- Host/associated rock described as volcanic, aphanitic volcanic rock.
- Ore role listed as gold-dominant.

Interpretation for RS:
- Volcanic-hosted Au-Ag workings can show mixed spectral behavior depending on vegetation recovery, soil exposure, and seasonal moisture.
- Your current index set is appropriate:
  - NDVI/SAVI for vegetation recovery/disturbance,
  - NDMI for moisture shifts,
  - NDBI/BSI/NDTI for exposed/disturbed surface behavior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Environmental Context and Risk Framing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Site-specific evidence:
- I did not find strong direct, recent public chemistry datasets uniquely tied to Monte Mayor in the reviewed open sources.

Regional framing:
- Neighboring eastern El Salvador districts have documented legacy mining-related environmental concerns in public/government discourse.
- Use this as contextual risk only; avoid claiming Monte Mayor-specific contamination without direct site evidence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Why Monte Mayor Matters in Your Actual Trend Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From your own `part_0_of_4` processed trends, Monte Mayor stands out as a top long-run changer:
- `mean_ndvi` (2000 m): +0.357 from 1984 to 2025 (largest long-run change in part 0)
- `mean_ndvi` (1000 m): +0.339 from 1984 to 2025
- `mean_bsi` (2000 m): -0.241
- `mean_ndmi` (2000 m): +0.233
- `mean_ndbi` (2000 m): -0.233

Interpretation (screening-level):
- Pattern is consistent with long-term vegetation recovery and reduced exposed/built-like spectral response, but this should be treated as inferential until tied to site-specific land-use/field evidence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Recommended Next Steps for Monte Mayor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Prioritize Monte Mayor for deeper archive work (historic company reports, government mining registries, old geologic maps).
2. Keep Monte Mayor in your high-priority RS anomaly review set (it has strong long-run multi-index movement).
3. Add an evidence-confidence field in your team tables:
   - A = direct primary source,
   - B = secondary but source-linked,
   - C = contextual/indirect.
4. For publication-quality claims, avoid specific operation-year statements unless independently verified.

- Sources 1-2 are strongest for this report.
- Source 3 is useful for aliases/host-rock hints but should be treated as secondary.
- Source 4 is district context and not a direct Monte Mayor operations ledger.
